Origins of My Journey: A Passion for Coding Ignited 18 Years Ago Introduction:

My journey into the realm of coding and programming commenced 18 years back, during my childhood days.
The spark was ignited when my parents took me to a concert, an event that would forever alter my trajectory.
At the concert, a mobile internet cafe captured my attention and opened the doors to the fascinating universe of technology.

Memorable Turning Point: Although many memories from my childhood have faded, one particular day stands out in vivid detail.
It was the day of the concert, a day that marked my inaugural encounter with technology.
Among the array of experiences, my introduction to tech was through engaging with flash games. 
This entry point into the world of technology resonates with many individuals in my field of interest. 

Inception of a Dream: From that pivotal moment onward, a profound realization took root within me. 
The interaction with those flash games illuminated a path I was destined to follow. 
This event cemented my aspiration to delve into the realm of technology, an aspiration that eventually steered me towards the domain of computer science.
